# Public Speaking
A few ideas randomly put together about things I learned in two years of doing talks at tech conferences. One day, they might end up in an actual training curricula.

## Slidedeck design

### TL;DR version
* slides are a visual aid
* big text, big images, text on image if possible
* contrast, bold colors
* no bullets
* show each element at a time, not full slide
* work on different sections, create visual separations
* use recaps after each section
* always come back at the main idea (the main takeaway)

### Full version

Slides are a visual aid:
* don't put full text nor full sentences, slides are not your reading support
* rule of thumb - going through the slides without seeing you should be pointless

Type of slides
* introducing yourself / ending
* one/multiples images with description
* one piece of text
* enumerating some concepts (preferrably not with bullets)
* diagrams
* animations (building up and sketching)
* background image with text
* recap slides (more on this later)

Typgraphy
* **BIG** fonts. Everyone should be able to see from the back row.
* careful with contrast, you might use some old projector with bad lighting
* don't put too much code in slides, rather use your editor to showcase (where you can zoom)

Elements to use or not
* NO BULLETS
* use short versions for links (ex: bit.ly)
* simple words
* a lot of emphasis (bold, underline, bigger fonts)
* no long quotes (add ...)

Order of slides
* customize for each event / location (personal touch)
* set the tone with an important message (your **main** idea)
* introduce yourself, but don't oversell it
* emphasize on the depth of the topic
* one slide with an overview of the talk (optional)
* use clearly separated sections (powerful colors help)
* recap after each major section or at the end
* one or a few slides at the end on the **main** idea (remember this is the key takeaway)

## Content creation

### TL;DR version

### Full version

Asking the right questions:
* - *WHO* are you talking to (audience)
* *HOW LONG* — Time & schedule
* *WHAT* — 1) sticks and 2) what can the audience learn?
* *WHY* — why this topic? why is it useful to talk about this?

The main idea
* there should always be ONE, not two, not three
* focus on it at the beginning and throughout the talk
* what is the key takeaway?
* come back obsessively to it
* come back to initial data / do comparison (ex: lines of code, speed, time)

Tell a story
* break the ice
* start with something people can relate to (everyone)
* express problems, offer solutions
* make it easy for people to follow
* add a WOW factor (present an innovative solution, show them something you have discovered, etc)
* always end on a high note, reiterate the **main idea**
* people should feel you are approachable

The end
* work on it because it's the thing the audience is left with (their impression)
* transmit again to everyone that you are approachable
* offer references and useful links
* link to your slides

Avoid
* overusing memes
* inapropriate jokes
* overused quotes (ex: "with great power ...")

Other good practices
* Keep personal notes with your ideas that go cross-presentations
* find your **way** to stand out
* rehearse! a lot!
