# Public Speaking
A few ideas randomly put together about things I learned in two years of doing talks at tech conferences. One day, they might end up in an actual training curricula.

## Slidedeck design

#### TL;DR version
* slides are a visual aid
* big text, big images, text on image if possible
* contrast, bold colors
* no bullets
* show each element at a time, not full slide
* work on different sections, create visual separations
* use recaps after each section
* always come back at the main idea (the main takeaway)

#### Full version

Slides are a visual aid:
* don't put full text nor full sentences, slides are not your reading support
* rule of thumb - going through the slides without seeing you should be pointless

Type of slides
* introducing yourself / ending
* one/multiples images with description
* one piece of text
* enumerating some concepts (preferrably not with bullets)
* diagrams
* animations (building up and sketching)
* background image with text
* recap slides (more on this later)

Typgraphy
* **BIG** fonts. Everyone should be able to see from the back row.
* careful with contrast, you might use some old projector with bad lighting
* don't put too much code in slides, rather use your editor to showcase (where you can zoom)

Elements to use or not
* NO BULLETS
* use short versions for links (ex: bit.ly)
* simple words
* a lot of emphasis (bold, underline, bigger fonts)
* no long quotes (add ...)

Order of slides
* customize for each event / location (personal touch)
* set the tone with an important message (your **main** idea)
* introduce yourself, but don't oversell it
* emphasize on the depth of the topic
* one slide with an overview of the talk (optional)
* use clearly separated sections (powerful colors help)
* recap after each major section or at the end
* one or a few slides at the end on the **main** idea (remember this is the key takeaway)
